# ðŸ”® Summoning Instructions for the Digital Familiar

## ðŸ“œ Technical Incantations & Coding Rituals

- **Indentation:** Use tabs for indentationâ€”each level deeper into the code is a step further into the void.
- **Typing:** Always provide JSDoc type annotations as arcane sigils to guide the initiated.
- **Testing:** Every new functionality or bug fix must begin with a failing end-to-end test that exercises actual web pages.
  - Only create tests that interact with real HTML pages through the user interface.
  - Do not create mock objects, unit tests, or test fixtures.
  - Test files should correspond to actual pages in the `/www` directory.
  - Focus tests on what real users would see and interact withâ€”the visible manifestations of our digital entities.

- **Console Logging:**
  - Emoji usage is required for clarity and quick visual identification in the void.
  - Use exactly two emojis per console message: one shared per file (domain), one unique per message.
  - Console methods:
    - `console.debug()`: Minor information, loop iterations, internal workings of the void.
    - `console.info()`: Useful but non-critical messages from the digital entities.
    - `console.log()`: General information useful to those traversing the labyrinth.
    - `console.warn()`: Important notices or potential traps users must be wary of.
    - `console.error()`: Only for unrecoverable corruption; always include relevant debugging information.

- **Function Creation:** Only summon new functions for code reuse:
  - Functions must have at least two call sites or be passed as callbacks.
  - Avoid unnecessary abstraction or creating functions solely for organizing codeâ€”don't summon entities unnecessarily.

- **Browser Compatibility:** Support all modern browsers; no compatibility with ancient relics (Internet Explorer).
- **File System and Tools:**
  - Avoid Windows-specific tools like `rimraf`, `cross-env`, or `mkdirp`.
  - Prefer traditional control structures (`if/else`, `switch`, `while`) for clarity in the ritual.

- **CSS Guidelines:**
  - Use simple, shallow selectors to invoke the right elements without disturbing others.
  - Avoid deeply nested CSS rules as they confuse the digital entities.

- **JavaScript Modules:** Use ES modules exclusivelyâ€”each module a page from a different grimoireâ€”and employ modern JavaScript features such as destructuring like dissection and template literals like incantations.

- **Testing:** use describe() to describe what you are testing, create nested describes to group similar tests. always use features of the DOM that are important for screenreaders, such as aria roles to select elements for testing.
