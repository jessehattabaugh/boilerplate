## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Configure your site: `npm run configure` (or manually edit the `public/config.js` file)
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

### Development Scripts

-   `npm start` - Start the development server
-   `npm run start:https` - Start with HTTPS for testing secure features
-   `npm run build` - Build for production (optimizes CSS)
-   `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality checks
-   `npm run test` - Run Playwright end-to-end tests
-   `npm run test:ui` - Run Playwright tests with UI for debugging
-   `npm run test:update-snapshots` - Update visual test baselines
-   `npm run test:update-performance` - Update performance baselines
-   `npm run analyze` - Analyze the site with Lighthouse

## Web Components

The boilerplate includes a sample web component that demonstrates how to create, test, and document components in this project.

### Example Component: Theme Toggle

The Theme Toggle component demonstrates how to create a fully tested web component using this boilerplate:

```html
<theme-toggle></theme-toggle>
```

This component provides a toggle for dark/light mode and demonstrates:

-   Encapsulation with Shadow DOM
-   Component styling
-   Event handling
-   Accessibility features
-   Performance optimization
-   Visual regression testing

For detailed documentation on this component and instructions for creating your own web components, see the [Web Components Documentation](./www/components/README.md).

## Accessibility Features

This boilerplate includes several accessibility enhancements:

### Reduced Motion Support

The site respects the user's motion preferences:

-   Uses the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query to disable animations and transitions
-   Provides alternative experiences for users who prefer reduced motion
-   Disables View Transitions for users with motion sensitivity
-   JavaScript animation logic is motion-preference aware

```css
/* Example of how animations respect user preferences */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
	.animate-element {
		transition: transform 0.3s ease;
	}
}
```

## Testing

### Testing Philosophy

This boilerplate embraces a practical testing philosophy:

1. **Production is the ultimate test** - Real users on real devices are the true validation
2. **Automated browser testing** against staging environments is the next best thing
3. **Local browser testing** during development provides immediate feedback

We deliberately avoid "mock-heavy" unit or integration tests that test abstractions rather than real user experiences.

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright

The boilerplate uses Playwright for comprehensive end-to-end testing which:

-   Tests your application in **real browsers** (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
-   Verifies behavior across **different devices and viewports**
-   Ensures **accessibility standards** are met
-   Provides **visual regression testing** to catch unexpected UI changes
-   Monitors **performance metrics** against established baselines

#### Included Test Types

-   **Functional tests**: Verify features work as expected
-   **Visual regression tests**: Catch unintended visual changes
-   **Accessibility tests**: Ensure the site works for all users
-   **Mobile responsiveness**: Test behavior on different devices
-   **Performance tests**: Monitor core web vitals and prevent regressions

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Quick test during development
npm run test

# Test against staging environment (closest to production)
npm run test:staging

# Update visual snapshots after intentional changes
npm run test:update-snapshots

# Update performance baselines after optimizations
npm run test:update-performance

# Debug tests interactively with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run just the theme toggle visual tests
npm run test:theme
```

#### Visual Regression Testing

The boilerplate includes visual regression tests that verify UI components maintain their expected appearance:

-   **Theme Toggle**: Tests verify the toggle functions correctly in all states
-   **Dark/Light Mode**: Screenshots are compared across theme changes to ensure proper styling
-   **Responsive Design**: Visual tests run across multiple viewport sizes

When making design changes, update the visual reference snapshots:

```bash
# Update visual snapshots after intentional UI changes
npm run test:update-snapshots
```

### Performance Testing

This boilerplate includes a comprehensive performance testing system:

#### How it works

1. **Performance baselines**: Each component and page has baseline metrics saved in the `/performance` directory
2. **Automated testing**: Tests run on each build and compare current performance against baselines
3. **Threshold alerts**: Tests fail if performance degrades beyond configurable thresholds
4. **Lighthouse integration**: For index pages, full Lighthouse audits are run and results tracked

#### Performance metrics tracked

-   **Core Web Vitals**: First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
-   **Interaction metrics**: Total Blocking Time (TBT), Time to Interactive (TTI)
-   **Navigation metrics**: Time to First Byte (TTFB), DOM Load, Full Page Load
-   **Component-level metrics**: Toggle operation time, memory usage, etc.

#### Managing performance baselines

After intentional performance changes or optimizations, update the baselines:

```bash
# Update performance baselines
npm run test:update-performance
```

This will run all tests with the baseline update flag and save current metrics as the new baseline.

#### Performance test file organization

-   Performance tests are integrated into component-specific test files
-   Each test file measures specific metrics relevant to that component
-   The utils/performance-utils.js module provides shared testing utilities
-   Baseline metrics are stored in the /performance directory as JSON files

### Writing Effective Tests

When adding new features, write Playwright tests that:

1. Focus on **user journeys** rather than implementation details
2. Use **accessibility-friendly selectors** like `getByRole` and `getByLabel`
3. Test across **multiple browsers and devices**
4. Include **visual regression** and **performance** tests
5. Verify **accessibility** requirements are met

Example of a good test case:

```javascript
test('user can toggle theme', async ({ page }) => {
	await page.goto('/');

	// Find element by its accessible role
	const themeToggle = page.getByRole('switch', { name: /toggle theme/i });

	// Verify initial state
	await expect(themeToggle).toBeVisible();
	const initialTheme = await page.evaluate(() =>
		document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark-mode') ? 'dark' : 'light',
	);

	// Perform action
	await themeToggle.click();

	// Verify result
	const newTheme = await page.evaluate(() =>
		document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark-mode') ? 'dark' : 'light',
	);
	expect(newTheme).not.toBe(initialTheme);

	// Check performance metrics for the operation
	const metrics = await getBrowserPerformanceMetrics(page);
	await assertPerformanceBaseline('theme-toggle-operation', metrics);
});
```

See the `tests` directory for more examples.

## Visual Testing

This project uses Playwright's visual comparison testing to ensure UI consistency:

### How snapshot testing works

1. The first time tests run, baseline screenshots are captured
2. On subsequent runs, new screenshots are compared against the baselines
3. Tests fail if there are visual differences beyond the threshold

### Managing snapshots

-   **Update snapshots:** After intentional UI changes, run `npm run test:update-snapshots`
-   **Clean temporary snapshots:** Remove diff and actual files with `npm run test:clean-snapshots`
-   **View differences:** Check the Playwright report for side-by-side comparison of visual changes

### Snapshot organization

-   Baseline snapshots are stored in `/snapshots/` with the naming convention `*-baseline.png`
-   Only baseline snapshots are committed to git
-   The snapshot directory uses a flat structure for simplicity

### Best practices

-   Keep snapshot regions focused on specific UI elements when possible
-   Use full page snapshots sparingly to reduce false positives
-   Consider device-specific variations in your tests

## PWA Screenshots

The boilerplate includes tools for generating PWA screenshots for the web app manifest:

```bash
# Generate screenshots from local development server
npm run screenshots

# Generate screenshots from production site
npm run screenshots:prod
```

These screenshots are used in the `manifest.json` file and help create better installation experiences when users add your PWA to their home screen.

The script automatically captures:

-   Desktop screenshot (1280x800)
-   Mobile screenshot (750x1334) with proper device scaling

Screenshots are saved to `/public/screenshots/` and the manifest.json is automatically updated.

## Best Practices

This boilerplate follows these best practices:

-   Progressive enhancement
-   Mobile-first design
-   Semantic HTML
-   Performance optimization
-   Accessibility (WCAG compliance)
-   Keyboard navigability
-   Screen reader compatibility
-   Reduced motion support

## Customization

Edit the variables in `public/styles/all.css` to customize the design system.
Configure site details in `public/scripts/config.js`.

## Browser Support

Supports all modern browsers. IE is not supported.
